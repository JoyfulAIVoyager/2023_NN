I. Project Title:
-------------------------------------------------------------
Neural Forecasting: Predicting Corporate Bankruptcy from Financial Indicators

II. Project Introduction:
--------------------------------------
Objective:


To design and implement a neural network model that can accurately predict the risk of corporate bankruptcy from given quarterly financial indicators

Motivation:

With global economic shifts and uncertain markets, businesses are at ever-evolving risks. An advanced warning system predicting potential financial distress can be invaluable. Neural networks, with their ability to detect complex patterns from large datasets, can be a vital tool for such predictions, potentially saving stakeholders from significant losses.

III. Dataset Description:
---------------------------------------
The dataset, sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, contains several financial metrics recorded for various companies. Each data point is labeled with a binary value, indicating whether or not the company went bankrupt

Features:

Current Ratio
Quick Ratio
Debt Equity Ratio
Net Profit Margin
Return on Assets
... [more features representing financial metrics]

Label:

Bankruptcy Status (1: Went Bankrupt, 0: Did not go bankrupt)


The dataset will be split into training, validation, and test sets. The training and validation sets will be used to develop and tune the model, while the test set will be reserved to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
